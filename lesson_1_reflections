How did viewing a diff between two versions of a 
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It pointed out the locations of the changes
so I could go back and see any errors that might
have occurred during development.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can revert your changes whenever necessary.
